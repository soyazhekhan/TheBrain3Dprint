# TheBrain3Dprint

3d printing the brain of a 13 year old 

This was a project to create an displayable 3d printed model from MRI scans of a 13 year old girl. The Original STL file was multiple solid bodies created directly from mesh cloud from the MRI scan. All the minute bodies were cleaned off the model to begin with. Then each section of the brain was seperated and multiple STLs were created. All these STL manipulations were done using Autodesk Netfabb and Autodesk Fusion 360.

In order for the model to be displayable, the parts needed to connect back together. So, holes were created to insert connection pins. The orientaion of the connection pins were chosen so the model would not fall apart if pick-up. Also, an angle of 1 degree was introdeced for the pin connection to assure a tight fit. A stand was also added to assist display. The display stand was created in Autodesk Inventor and combined with other models using Autodesk Netfabb.

The printing was done in white PLA. The print wsa 1:1 or life-size. The whole print took a little over 50 hours to complete. 1/4" zinc plated steel pins were used to connect the pieces.

The final results can be seen in the images and the STLs.
